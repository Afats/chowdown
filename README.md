# Chowdown

Gotta chow em' all!
Currently only unique singles teams are supported. Support for doubles, and multiple instances of pokemon in either team/s coming soon.



## Setup

1. Have the latest Python and pip versions installed.
2. The bot currently runs on a Chrome browser. Have your Chromedriver and Chome updated to the latest versions. More info [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
3. Download the repo and run the following in the repo's directory:
`pip install -r requirements. txt`
4. Run `python chowdown.py` in the repo directory <b> after sending the initial pokemon out</b>.
5. Enter the battle link or code into the program.
6. Enjoy :D
